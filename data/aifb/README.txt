1. Description: The AIFB dataset describes the AIFB research institute in terms of its staff, research group, and publications. In (Bloehdorn et al 2007) the dataset was first used to predict the affiliation (i.e., research group) for people in the dataset. The dataset contains 178 members of a research group, however the smallest group contains only 4 people, so this one is removed from the dataset, leaving 4 classes. Moreover, we also remove the \texttt{employs relation, which is the inverse of the affiliation relation from the dataset.
